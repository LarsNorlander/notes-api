# A Notes App Specification

## But Why?

This project exists so that I could try my hand at writing an API specification, and also provide myself with a basic
project that I (or you, if you'd like) could implement when learning how to implement a backend technology stack.

This will be a very simple CRUD API, and it's meant to be boring. The idea is that if you're learning say, building a 
serverless application in AWS, you'll focus more on the AWS part and less about all the other aspects of building a 
service.

## What Will Be the Features of This Notes App?

The following basic features should be provided:

* A user should be capable of creating, editing, and deleting notes.
* A user could put labels on individual notes.
* A user could list notes, and use labels to filter them.

Ideally, there should also be authentication so that multiple users could use the application.
